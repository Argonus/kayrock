# Kayrock

WIP towards providing an idiomatic Elixir interface to the Kafka protocol.

This work is based on [https://github.com/klarna/kafka_protocol](kafka_protocl)
for Erlang, which is used in [https://github.com/klarna/brod](brod).  It is
intended to eventually work with [https://github.com/kafkaex/kafka_ex](KafkaEx).
